                            "Object Sorting based on Colour and Shape using Niryo Robotic Arm (NED2)"
Details:
1.  Either create your own workspace, or use a workspace created by default.
    To create workspace: open NiryoStudio App, go to Library > Workspaces > Create new
2. Open NiryoStudio, and connect to the Niryo Robot

3. Code sorts objects based on the color (Red, Green, and Blue).
4. It only works with "square" shaped objects

5. Conveyor belt is used to move objects to the workspace
6. IR Sensor is also used to stop the objects within the workspace
